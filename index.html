				Reducing  the overall mass of spacecraft yields an increase in fuel efficiency, one of  the most expensive aspects of space travel. The replacement of metallic components with polymer-matrix composites is one strategy  to  provide  comparable  structural  performance  while  reducing  weight. One  such  component  is the  fuel  tank  assembly,  which  holds  liquid  oxygen  fuel  at  cryogenic  temperatures.  This  component  is housed  inside  the  fuselage  and  is  therefore  not  exposed  to  significant  radiation  or  ablation  during  any stage of spaceflight. In this scenario, the engineering team has already selected the reinforcement (carbon fiber) and computed the optimal reinforcement architecture for a pressure vessel. The engineering team also  has  experience  with  fabrication  of  pressure  vessels  such  that  they  have  tight  control  over reinforcement architecture. 

				<br/><br/>

				For  polymer-matrix  composites  to  replace  metals  in  this  application  they  must  possess  comparable strength  and  stiffness  to  high-strength  aluminum  alloys  while  minimizing  density.  As  opposed  to aluminum  alloys,  the  fibers  must  be  aligned  to  compensate  for  the  difference  in  hoop and longitudinal stresses in the composite shell. The composite must maintain structural integrity (i.e., fracture resistance) at  temperatures  far  below  the glass  transition  temperature  of  typical  matrix  polymers  (-207  °C). Therefore,  any  mismatch  of  coefficient  of  thermal  expansion  between  dissimilar  materials  must  be minimized and composite toughness must be maximized. The composite must only tolerate exposure to the oxygen fuel, which may degrade the polymer matrix, affect matrix-reinforcement interface behavior, and lead to embrittlement and catastrophic failure. Further, due to the large form factor of the fuel tank assembly, the layup process must be scalable.
